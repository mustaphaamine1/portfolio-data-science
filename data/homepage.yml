  subtitle: "Data Scientist / Data Analyst"
  description: "Hi, my name is Mustapha and I work remotely as a data analyst intern. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Data Science and I'm doing my Master’s degree in Quantitative and Financial Modelling. Since I was young, I have always enjoyed to solve puzzles. So that’s how I look at big data sets: to me it is one big puzzle I want to solve. Finding patterns nobody else sees is the challenge to me."
